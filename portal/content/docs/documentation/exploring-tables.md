Once you select one of the tables located on the sidebar or after uploading a file, ODE will offer a preview of the data on the main screen:

You can click on the icon next to the name of the column in the datagrid to explore data through the **Sort ascending**, **Sort descending** and **Unsort** options. You can also use the pagination feature at the bottom of the ODE to check rows and cells in more detail.
