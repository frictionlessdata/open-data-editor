## Adding / Editing Metadata

This map file can be either part of a package or a standalone resource file. To add/edit metadata such as license, contributors etc, you can use `Metadata Editor`. To open the metadata editor, click `Metadata` menu on the toolbar.

The editor contains three sections: Menu Explorer, Input Form and Helper Section. `Metadata Editor` provides easy way to update the metadata of the file.

## Source View
